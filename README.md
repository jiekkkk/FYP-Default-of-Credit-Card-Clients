# FYP-Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients

The dataset "Default of Credit Card Clients" was uploaded by I-Cheng Yeh and is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients). The dataset is a classification problem that determines whether the credit card holder will default or not. There are 25 attributes in total, and the raw dataset comprises 30,000 rows. There are 23,362 non-default credit card clients and 6,638 default credit card clients among the rows. There are five models used to compare their performance to determine which model is preferred for binary classification. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting are among the models used. The results show that Gaussian Naive Bayes is the most successful in forecasting credit card holder default. However, when all of the algorithms were compared, the result was determined that there were no substantial differences between them. The accuracy and AUC values of all the models are more than 75%. As a result, this report shows that all of the algorithms here predict well with the chosen feature. The model is then used to construct a scorecard to assess the user's creditworthiness, allowing the financial loss from the credit card company to be avoided.
